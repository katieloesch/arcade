### Day 1 - 03/02/2024

I started this project by setting up the basic folder structure and creating html/CSS/JS files.

I also created a wireframe on Excalidraw to get an idea of the basic layout of the website.

I wanted the background to look like the matrix effect so I created a canvas element and some JS code for the animation.
